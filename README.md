# Stock Storm

Stock Storm is an application with a React frontend and a NestJS backend including these features

## Frontend

- You would use React to build the user interface for the application. You could use a library such as Material-UI for styling.
- You would use axios or fetch to make API calls to the backend to retrieve stock information.
- The frontend would allow users to search for stocks by symbol, view the latest information about a stock (e.g. price, percent change, volume), and save and view their favorite stocks.

## Backend

- You would use NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- You would use the IEX Cloud, AlphaVantage or Yahoo Finance to retrieve stock information.
- The backend would handle the API calls from the frontend and return the requested stock information in the format expected by the frontend.
- You would also use a technology such as MongoDB or MySQL to store user information, such as their favorite stocks.
- You could also include a feature to update the stock price,volume, etc in real-time.
